# bird-watcher
Essentially it's a CCTV system, but it's meant specifically for watching birds at a feeder or in a nest box. It's designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 4, and as such does not feature GPU acceleration. However, it does make efficent use of all CPU cores available to it. Check out the readme for more info.
